# Mobile Apps (Driver & Vendor) – Placeholder

This folder will host the React Native (Expo) applications for driver and vendor experiences. The MVP backlog includes:

- Driver job inbox, navigation launcher, and background telemetry capture.
- Vendor job acceptance, catalog management, and wallet payouts.
- Offline-first cache with sync once connectivity resumes.

Implementation will begin after the web and API foundations are stable (Roadmap Milestone M2).
